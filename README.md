## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

As a security professional supporting a research team, I was responsible for verifying and updating the permissions of files and directories. This helped ensure users had the appropriate level of access and that unauthorized modifications were prevented. I used Linux commands such as `ls` and `chmod` to identify permission misconfigurations and correct them in line with organizational policies.
